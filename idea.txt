Provide schema (schema_data.csv) to llm


ask llm to produce query
setup a function to query the db from the llm
llm gets data
take data and send to llm agent to produce python code for the graph


Currently
---------------------
main.py
will read the sql db to get a schema, tables and data and output these into csv

graph.py
uses hardcoded data at the mo and will produce a png of it
